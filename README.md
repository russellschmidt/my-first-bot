#My First Chatbot
## The Octorusty Chatbot
Welcome... to the future... today *is* tomorrow, and now has thusfore become... **nowmorrow**

There is no point to Rusty Chatbot in a traditional sense of a point as understood as purpose or raison d'etre or California raisin in the sun. No sir or ma'am there is nothing here but pure Artificial Intelligentsia, pureed to a fine mist, cooled by the summer breeze of the Pacific Ocean, and broiled in a souffle of human spirit and raw computational power.

## What does it do
What doesn't it do?
I should ask you
It won't wear a shoe
Like a humanputer made of goo

It talks to you, currently using Facebook Messenger. (Chat with me here)[https://www.facebook.com/octorustybot/]

## What is it made of?
This silicon-based life form is powered by (botpress)[https://github.com/botpress], the WordPress for chatbots.

## Can I steal your code?
No, because you cannot steal that which is freely given away, any more than you can steal a breath or the pleasure to be found in humming a sacred hymn. Open Source under the (Botpress Proprietary License)[https://github.com/botpress/botpress/blob/master/licenses/LICENSE_BOTPRESS] and (GNU General Public License)[https://github.com/botpress/botpress/blob/master/licenses/LICENSE_AGPL3].

Now *should* you steal this code is a better question.

## Should I steal your code?
Glad you asked, chief. There are plenty of great examples out there to also borrow liberally from.
